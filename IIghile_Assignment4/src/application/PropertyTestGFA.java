 * Class: CMSC203 CRN 23118
Program: Assignment #4
Instructor: Huseyin Aygun
Summary of Description: This project is a Java program that simulates a property management system for a real estate company. The system manages up to five properties, each with its own location, size, owner, and rental amount. It uses three main classes (Plot, Property, and ManagementCompany) to model how properties are contained within plots of land and managed collectively. The program implements key object-oriented concepts such as aggregation, encapsulation, copy constructors, method overloading, and array-based object storage. A GUI is provided to interact with the system, allowing users to add properties, calculate total rent, display the highest-rent property, and list all properties. The project also includes JUnit testing for each class to ensure correctness and reliability.
Due Date: 10/27/2025
